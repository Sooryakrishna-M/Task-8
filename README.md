Insights from the Super Store Sales Dashboard

1- Sales peaked in November and December, with November hitting the highest mark at 150K. This suggests strong seasonal demand, likely tied to year-end sales or holiday promotions.

2- Technology leads in both sales and profit among all product categories, making it the most valuable segment. Office Supplies and Furniture generate lower revenue and profits in comparison.

3- The West region is the top-performing sales region with total sales reaching 277K, followed by East and Central. The South region lags behind significantly with just 148K, indicating potential for growth.

4- Monthly sales show a sharp drop after December, declining steadily through the first half of the year. This trend may indicate a post-holiday sales slump and should be considered when planning marketing efforts.
